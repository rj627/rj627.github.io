The best way to reach me is by email, rj438 at cornell dot edu. I'm also on [Twitter](twitter.com/ririfan001) and 
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rj627).

I'm always happy to chat about transients, using TESS data for non-exoplanet science, or pretty much anything 
related to my work or hobbies! I'm also super passionate about graduate student unionization, and always 
happy to talk about my experience organizing and bargaining on behalf of the MIT GSU.
