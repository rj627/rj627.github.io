<!-- <h2>Service Work</h2> -->

I have served as a referee for <a href="https://www.aanda.org/">Astronomy & Astrophysics</a>, 
and a reviewer for proposals submitted to the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope.

Outside of astrophysics research, I have been involved in initiatives to promote equity in admissions, 
as well as climate committees for both the MIT Physics Department and the MIT Kavli Institute. 
Some of the committees I have served on include:

<ul>
    <li> MIT Physics Values Working Group (2020 Sep - 2022 Aug) </li>
    <li> MIT Physics Graduate Admissions Committee (2020 Aug - 2022 Jul) </li>
    <li> MIT Kavli Institute Anti-Racism Task Force (2020 Jun - 2020 Aug) </li>
</ul>

I was also President of the Physics Graduate Student Council in my third year, where I helped oversee
the safe transition from remote events to in-person events on MIT's campus. During my fourth year,
I joined the <a href="mitgsu.org">MIT Graduate Student Union</a> as the Physics Department's representative to the Bargaining
Committee. We secured a leading contract, which <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n-jJmOu_4R6aj_4qp_P0ef83hZR9z3ABU70puyv09go/edit">enshrined key protections</a> for graduate students.
