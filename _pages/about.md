Hello! I'm Rahul Jayaraman <a href="https://pronouns.org/what-and-why">(he/him)</a>, a 5th-year PhD student in the <a href="https://physics.mit.edu/">MIT Department of Physics</a>, and affiliated
with the <a href="https://space.mit.edu/">MIT Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research</a>. I use the
<a href="tess.mit.edu">Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite</a> (TESS) to study things that are <i>not</i> exoplanets. 

Throughout my PhD, I've become an expert at analyzing all forms of TESS data for pretty much any astrophysical science case that
involves studying photometric variability.
My main scientific interest lies in <b>transient science and multi-messenger astronomy</b>. I'm especially interested in using TESS
to find <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05148">optical counterparts to gamma-ray bursts</a> and 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04881">gravitational-wave mergers</a> through the use of a transient search 
pipeline for the TESS full-frame images. In addition to hunting for transients, I've 
also been spearheading a search for ''<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01722">tidally tilted pulsators</a>,'' which are pulsating stars in binary systems where
the gravitational field of the companion strongly affects the pulsations.

I've been heavily involved in departmental service work, having served as the President of the <a href="https://physics-gsc.scripts.mit.edu/home/">Physics
Graduate Student Council</a> from 2021-2022, and as the Physics representative to the <a href="https://mitgsu.org/">MIT Graduate Student Union</a> Bargaining Committee
from 2022-2023. I was also one of the first graduate student readers for the MIT Physics admissions committee (from 2020-2021),
and have been involved in Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) work both within MKI and the Physics Department.

Outside of astrophysics, I enjoy <a href="https://my.flightradar24.com/ririfan1">airplanes 
and travel</a>, rock climbing, fine dining, watching foreign TV shows, and listening 
to EDM, among other things.
