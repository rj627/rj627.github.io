Hello! I'm Rahul Jayaraman <a href="https://pronouns.org/what-and-why">(he/him)</a>, a <a href="https://as.cornell.edu/research/klarman-fellowships">Klarman Fellow</a> in the College of Arts & Science at Cornell University. I received my PhD from the MIT
Department of Physics in spring 2025, with a focus on time-domain astrophysics (transients and asteroseismology) using the 
<a href="https://tess.mit.edu">Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite</a>.

At Cornell,  I've begun working with the <a href="https://www.ztf.caltech.edu/">Zwicky Transient Facility</a> (ZTF) collaboration, on 
synergies with TESS in the study of early- and late-time emission from a variety of transients. In particular, I'm interested in searching for
interaction signatures in early-time light curves from supernovae, as well as constraining late-time flaring from luminous Fast
Blue Optical Transients (LFBOTs). This follows my PhD work into the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05148">prompt 
optical flash</a> that can often accompany gamma-ray bursts---a phenomenon that is extremely difficult to observe from the ground, 
but can be <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06285">combined with high-energy observations</a> to characterize the jet physics.

I'm also interested in binary asteroseismology with TESS; in particular, I am studying how 
the tidal forces from a tight binary companion can affect stellar pulsations, leading to 
''<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01722">tidally tilted pulsators</a>,''  and
''tri-axial'' pulsations (see, e.g., <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16248">here</a> and 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03815">here</a> for analyses of the first two TAPs discovered).

I've been heavily involved in <a href='/service'>departmental service work</a>, having served as the President of the <a href="https://physics-gsc.scripts.mit.edu/home/">Physics
Graduate Student Council</a> from 2021-2022, and as the Physics representative to the <a href="https://mitgsu.org/">MIT Graduate Student Union</a> Bargaining Committee
from 2022-2023. I was also one of the first graduate student readers for the MIT Physics admissions committee (from 2020-2021),
and have been involved in Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) work both within MKI and the Physics Department. A full listing
of my service activities (and publications) can be found in 
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15oNMD-4PipdFS3q4nLczaJlm2NJ3TqJj/view?usp=sharing">my CV</a> (current as of 2024 November).

Outside of astrophysics, I enjoy <a href="https://my.flightradar24.com/ririfan1">airplanes 
and travel</a>, rock climbing, fine dining, watching foreign TV shows, and listening 
to EDM, among other things.
