The pipeline I developed to find unique pulsating stars (see <a href="/projects/2_project">here</a>) was also useful in finding and characterizing
(a) multiple stellar systems, as well as (b) magnetic stars. 

<ul>
    <li> I worked with a large team of amateur astronomers/citizen scientists to analyze
    BU CMi, <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.524.4220P/abstract">the tightest-known flat 
    quadruple system</a>. This was discovered both by my pipeline and independently by a group of visual surveyors.
    Given that it was bright enough to be observed from the ground by small telescopes, including KELT, we were 
    able to calculate the system parameters--including apsidal precession--to unprecedented precision.</li>
    <li> I used TESS to present the <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...924L..10J/abstract">first-ever
    characterization</a> of a magnetospheric star based solely on
    photometric variability. With follow-up observations to determine a magnetic field, we were able to
    show that TESS data is useful to study magnetically trapped material. The same analyses were extended
    to M dwarfs, a small fraction of which exhibit corotating clouds of trapped material 
    (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024AJ....167...38B/abstract">most recent paper</a>). </li>
    <li> I was heavily involved in the creation and curation of the 
    <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024MNRAS.527.3995K/abstract">first catalog of quadruple stars</a>
    with TESS, as well as analyses of magnetic stars (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.516.2629J/abstract">Ap stars</a>, and 
    <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.524L..21J/abstract">Wolf-Rayet stars</a>).</li>
</ul>
