      abstract = {We present the results of a systematic search of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) 
      2-min cadence data for new rapidly oscillating Ap (roAp) stars observed during the Cycle 2 phase of its mission.
      We find seven new roAp stars previously unreported as such and present the analysis of a further 25 roAp stars 
      that are already known. Three of the new stars show multiperiodic pulsations, while all new members are rotationally 
      variable stars, leading to almost 70 per cent (22) of the roAp stars presented being α2 CVn-type variable stars. 
      We show that targeted observations of known chemically peculiar stars are likely to overlook many new roAp stars, 
      and demonstrate that multiepoch observations are necessary to see pulsational behaviour changes. We find a lack of 
      roAp stars close to the blue edge of the theoretical roAp instability strip, and reaffirm that mode instability is 
      observed more frequently with precise, space-based observations. In addition to the Cycle 2 observations, we analyse 
      TESS data for all-known roAp stars. This amounts to 18 further roAp stars observed by TESS. Finally, we list six known 
      roAp stars that TESS is yet to observe. We deduce that the incidence of roAp stars amongst the Ap star population is 
      just 5.5 per cent, raising fundamental questions about the conditions required to excite pulsations in Ap stars. This 
      work, coupled with our previous work on roAp stars in Cycle 1 observations, presents the most comprehensive, homogeneous 
      study of the roAp stars in the TESS nominal mission, with a collection of 112 confirmed roAp stars in total.}

      abstract = {Classical gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have two distinct emission episodes: prompt emission from ultra-relativistic ejecta 
      and afterglow from shocked circumstellar material. While both components are extremely luminous in known GRBs, a variety of scenarios 
      predict the existence of luminous afterglow emission with little or no associated high-energy prompt emission. We present AT 2019pim, 
      the first secure example of this phenomenon to be identified. Serendipitously discovered during follow-up observations of a 
      gravitational-wave trigger and located in a contemporaneous TESS sector, it is hallmarked by a fast-rising (t ~ 2 hr), 
      luminous (M_UV,peak ~ -24.4 mag) optical transient with accompanying luminous X-ray and radio emission. No gamma-ray 
      emission consistent with the time and location of the transient was detected by Fermi-GBM or by Konus, placing strong limits 
      on an accompanying GRB. We investigate several independent observational aspects of the afterglow in the context of constraints 
      on relativistic motion and find all of them are consistent with an initial Lorentz factor of Gamma_0 ~ 30-50, significantly lower 
      than in any well-observed GRB and consistent with the theoretically-predicted "dirty fireball" scenario in which the high-energy 
      prompt emission is stifled by pair production. However, we cannot rule out a structured jet model in which only the line-of-sight 
      material was ejected at low-Gamma, off-axis from a classical high-Gamma jet core. This event represents a milestone in orphan 
      afterglow searches, demonstrating that luminous afterglows with weak or no detectable gamma-ray radiation exist in nature and 
      can be discovered by high-cadence optical surveys.}

      abstract = {We present 307 type Ia supernova (SN) light curves from the first 4 yr of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite 
      mission. We use this sample to characterize the shapes of the early-time light curves, measure the rise times from first light 
      to peak, and search for companion star interactions. Using simulations, we show that light curves must have noise <10% of the 
      peak flux to avoid biases in the early-time light-curve shape, restricting our quantitative analysis to 74 light curves. We 
      find that the mean power-law index ${t}^{{\beta }_{1}}$ of the early-time light curves is β 1 = 1.93 ± 0.57, and the mean 
      rise time to peak is 15.7 ± 3.5 days. The underlying population distribution for β 1 may instead consist of a Gaussian 
      component with mean 2.29, width 0.34, and a long tail extending to values less than 1.0. We find that the data can 
      rarely distinguish between models with and without companion interaction models. Nevertheless, we find three high-quality 
      light curves that tentatively prefer the addition of a companion interaction model, but the statistical evidence for the 
      companion interactions is not robust. We also find two SNe that disfavor the addition of a companion interaction model to a 
      curved power-law model. Taking the 74 SNe together, we calculate 3σ upper limits on the presence of companion signatures 
      to control for orientation effects that can hide companions in individual light curves. Our results rule out common progenitor 
      systems with companions having Roche lobe radii >31 R ⊙ (separations >5.7 × 1012 cm, 99.9% confidence level) and disfavor 
      companions having Roche lobe radii >10 R ⊙ (separations >1.9 × 1012 cm, 95% confidence level). Lastly, we discuss the 
      implications of our results for the intrinsic fraction of single degenerate progenitor systems.}

     abstract = {Type Ia supernovae are cosmic distance indicators, and the main source of iron in the Universe, but their formation paths 
     are still debated. Several dozen supersoft X-ray sources, in which a white dwarf accretes hydrogen-rich matter from a non-degenerate 
     donor star, have been observed5 and suggested as Type Ia supernovae progenitors. However, observational evidence for hydrogen, 
     which is expected to be stripped off the donor star during the supernova explosion, is lacking. Helium-accreting white dwarfs, 
     which would circumvent this problem, have been predicted for more than 30 years, including their appearance as supersoft X-ray sources, 
     but have so far escaped detection. Here we report a supersoft X-ray source with an accretion disk whose optical spectrum is
     completely dominated by helium, suggesting that the donor star is hydrogen-free. We interpret the luminous and supersoft X-rays as 
     resulting from helium burning near the surface of the accreting white dwarf. The properties of our system provide evidence for
      extended pathways towards Chandrasekhar-mass explosions based on helium accretion, in particular for stable burning in white 
      dwarfs at lower accretion rates than expected so far. This may allow us to recover the population of the sub-energetic so-called 
      Type Iax supernovae, up to 30% of all Type Ia supernovae, within this scenario.}
