      abstract={The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has enabled the discovery of numerous tidally tilted pulsators 
      (TTPs), which are pulsating stars in close binaries where the presence of a tidal bulge has the effect of tilting the 
      primary star's pulsation axes into the orbital plane. Recently, the modeling framework developed to analyze TTPs has 
      been applied to the emerging class of triaxial pulsators, which exhibit nonradial pulsations about three perpendicular 
      axes. In this work, we report on the identification of the second-ever discovered triaxial pulsator, with 16 robustly 
      detected pulsation multiplets, of which 14 are dipole doublets separated by 2 \nu_{orb}. We jointly fit the spectral energy 
      distribution and TESS light curve of the star, and find that the primary is slightly evolved off the zero-age main 
      equence, while the less massive secondary still lies on the zero-age main sequence. Of the 14 doublets, we associate 
      eight with Y_10x modes and six with novel Y_10y modes. We exclude the existence of Y_11x modes in this star and show 
      that the observed pulsation modes must be Y_10y . We also present a toy model for the triaxial pulsation framework in 
      the context of this star. The techniques presented here can be utilized to rapidly analyze and confirm future triaxial \
      pulsator candidates.}

     abstract = {Very few detections have been made of optical flashes contemporaneous with prompt high-energy 
     emission from a gamma-ray burst (GRB). In this work, we present and analyze light curves of GRB-associated 
     optical flashes and afterglows from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). Our sample consists 
     of eight GRBs with arcsecond-level localizations from the X-Ray Telescope on board the Neil Gehrels Swift 
     Observatory (Swift). For each burst, we characterize the prompt optical emission and any observed afterglow, 
     and constrain physical parameters for four of these bursts using their TESS light curves. This work also 
     presents a straightforward method to correct for TESS's cosmic-ray mitigation strategy on 20 s timescales, 
     which allows us to estimate the "true" brightness of optical flashes associated with prompt GRB emission. 
     We also highlight TESS's continuous wide-field monitoring capability, which provides an efficient means of 
     identifying optical emission from GRBs and characterizing early time afterglow light curves. Based on empirical 
     detection rates from Swift and the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, up to 10 GRBs per year may fall within 
     the contemporaneous TESS field of view.}

      abstract = {Using TESS 20 s cadence data, we have discovered an unusual combination of pulsating stars 
     in what we infer to be a binary system. The binary consists of a standard δ Scuti star with pulsations 
     over the range 32-41 1/d; this is in a likely wide orbit with a hot subdwarf-B (sdB) star, which itself has a 
     large-amplitude p-mode pulsation at 524 1/d. We establish constraints on the period of the putative binary by using 
     radial velocity measurements of the δ Scuti star and show that any sdB companion star must orbit with a period 
     greater than approximately thirty days. Our identification of this sdB binary serves as an important addition
      to the relatively small number of sdB binaries known to have orbital periods longer than a few days. 
      We model such a binary using MESA and find that this system could be formed through stable, nonconservative 
      mass transfer from either a low-mass or an intermediate-mass progenitor, without undergoing a common-envelope phase.}

     abstract = {Tidally tilted pulsators (TTPs) are an intriguing new class of oscillating 
     stars in binary systems; in such stars, the pulsation axis coincides with the line of apsides, 
     or tidal axis, of the binary. All three TTPs discovered so far have been δ Scuti stars. In this 
     Letter, we report the first conclusive discovery of tidally tilted pulsations in a subdwarf B 
     (sdB) star. HD 265435 is an sdB-white dwarf binary with a 1.65 hr period that has been identified 
     and characterized as the nearest potential Type Ia supernova progenitor. Using TESS 20 s cadence 
     data from Sectors 44 and 45, we show that the pulsation axis of the sdB star has been tidally tilted 
     into the orbital plane and aligned with the tidal axis of the binary. We identify 31 independent pulsation 
     frequencies, 27 of which have between 1 and 7 sidebands separated by the orbital frequency (ν orb) or multiples 
     thereof. Using the observed amplitude and phase variability due to tidal tilting, we assign ℓ and m values 
     to most of the observed oscillation modes and use these mode identifications to generate preliminary 
     asteroseismic constraints. Our work significantly expands our understanding of TTPs, as we now know 
     that (i) they can be found in stars other than δ Scuti pulsators, especially highly evolved stars 
     that have lost their H-rich envelopes, and (ii) tidally tilted pulsations can be used to probe the 
     interiors of stars in very tight binaries.}

     on photometric and spectropolarimetric observations. The TESS light 
     curve of this star exhibited variations consistent with stars known to possess rigidly 
     rotating magnetospheres (RRMs), so we obtained spectropolarimetric observations using the
     Robert Stobie Spectrograph (RSS) on the South African Large Telescope (SALT) at four different 
     rotational phases. From these observations, we calculated the longitudinal magnetic field of 
     the star \<Bz\>, as well as the Alfven and Kepler radii, and deduced that this star contains a 
     centrifugal magnetosphere. However, an archival spectrum does not exhibit the characteristic 
     "double-horned" emission profile for H-alpha and the Brackett series that has been observed 
     in many other RRM stars. This could be due to the insufficient rotational phase coverage of 
     the available set of observations, as the spectra of these stars significantly vary with 
     the star's rotation. Our analysis underscores the use of TESS in photometrically identifying 
     magnetic star candidates for spectropolarimetric follow-up using ground-based instruments. 
     We are evaluating the implementation of a machine-learning classifier to search for more 
     examples of RRM stars in TESS data.}
