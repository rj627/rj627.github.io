     abstract = {We have discovered a δ Scuti pulsator in a tight binary (P = 1.053 d) 
     with nine pulsation modes whose frequencies are between 38 and 56 d-1. Each of these modes 
     exhibits amplitude modulations and π-rad phase shifts twice per orbital cycle. Five of these 
     modes exhibit amplitude and phase shifts that are readily explained by dipole pulsations along 
     an axis that is aligned with the binary's tidal axis. The novelty of the system lies in the 
     remaining four pulsation modes, which we show are dipole pulsations along an axis that is 
     perpendicular to both the tidal axis and the binary's orbital angular momentum axis. There are 
     additionally two pulsation modes whose amplitudes and phases do not change significantly with 
     orbital phase; they are explained as dipole modes along an axis aligned with the orbital/rotation 
     axis. Hence, we propose that TIC 184 743 498 is a tri-axial pulsator, the first of its kind.}

      abstract = {Complex periodic variables (CPVs) are stars that exhibit highly structured and periodic optical light curves. 
      Previous studies have indicated that these stars are typically disk-free pre-main-sequence M dwarfs with rotation periods 
      ranging from 0.2 to 2 days. To advance our understanding of these enigmatic objects, we conducted a blind search using TESS 
      2 minute data of 65,760 K and M dwarfs with T<16 mag and d<150 pc. We found 50 high-quality CPVs, and subsequently determined 
      that most are members of stellar associations. Among the new discoveries are the brightest (T ≈ 9.5 mag), closest (d ≈ 20 pc),
       and oldest (≈200 Myr) CPVs known. One exceptional object, LP 12-502, exhibited up to eight flux dips per cycle. Some of these 
       dips coexisted with slightly different periods, and the shortest-duration dips precisely matched the expected timescale for 
       transiting small bodies at the corotation radius. Broadly, our search confirms that CPVs are mostly young (≲150 Myr) 
       and low-mass (≲0.4 M ⊙). The flux dips characteristic of the class have lifetimes of ≈100 cycles, although stellar 
       flares seem to induce a sudden dip collapse once every few months. The most plausible explanation for 
       these phenomena remains corotating concentrations of gas or dust. The gas or dust is probably entrained 
       by the star's magnetic field, and the sharp features could result from a multipolar field topology, a hypothesis 
       supported by correspondences between the light curves of CPVs and of rapidly rotating B stars known to have multipolar 
       magnetic fields.},

    abstract = {Several studies have shown that a number of stars pulsating in p modes lie between the β Cep and δ Sct instability 
    strips in the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) Diagram. At present, there is no certain understanding of how p modes can be excited in 
    this Teff range. The goal of this work is to disprove the conjecture that all stars pulsating in p modes and lying in this 
    Teff range are the result of incorrect measurements of Teff, contamination, or the presence of unseen cooler companions 
    lying in the δ Sct instability strip (given the high binary fraction of stars in this region of the HR Diagram). Using TESS data, 
    we show that the A0Vnne star HD 42477 has a single p mode coupled to several r modes and/or g modes. We rule out a contaminating
     background star with a pixel-by-pixel examination, and we essentially rule out the possibility of a companion δ Sct star in a binary. 
     We model the pulsations in HD 42477, and suggest that the g modes are excited by overstable convective core modes. We also conjecture 
     that the single p mode is driven by coupling with the g modes, or that the oblateness of this rapidly-rotating star permits driving by 
     He II ionization in the equatorial region.}

      abstract = {In 2017, the LIGO and Virgo gravitational-wave (GW) detectors, in conjunction with electromagnetic (EM) astronomers, 
      observed the first GW multimessenger astrophysical event, the binary neutron star (BNS) merger GW170817. This marked the beginning 
      of a new era in multimessenger astrophysics. To discover further GW multimessenger events, we explore the synergies between the 
      Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and GW observations triggered by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration (LVK) detector 
      network. TESS's extremely wide field of view (~2300 deg2) means that it could overlap with large swaths of GW localizations, 
      which often span hundreds of square degrees or more. In this work, we use a recently developed transient detection pipeline 
      to search TESS data collected during the LVK's third observing run, O3, for any EM counterparts. We find no obvious counterparts 
      brighter than about 17th magnitude in the TESS bandpass. Additionally, we present end-to-end simulations of BNS mergers, including 
      their detection in GWs and simulations of light curves, to identify TESS's kilonova discovery potential for the LVK's next 
      observing run (O4). In the most optimistic case, TESS will observe up to one GW-found BNS merger counterpart per year. However, 
      TESS may also find up to five kilonovae that did not trigger the LVK network, emphasizing that EM-triggered GW searches may play a 
      key role in future kilonova detections. We also discuss how TESS can help place limits on EM emission from binary black hole mergers 
      and rapidly exclude large sky areas for poorly localized GW events.}
